1.⁠ ⁠User Interface
   - Input Fields: 
     - A text input for entering the name of a candy.
     - A number input for entering the quantity of the candy.
   - Add Button: A button to add the entered candy item to the inventory list.
   - Candy List: A list displaying all added candy items with their quantities.
   - Delete Button: A button next to each candy item for removing it from the list.

2.⁠ ⁠Functionality
   - Adding Candies: 
     - Users should be able to type a candy name and quantity in the input fields.
     - Upon clicking the "Add" button or pressing the Enter key, the candy item should be added to the inventory list.
     - After adding a candy item, the input fields should be cleared, ready for new entries.
   - Displaying Candies:
     - Display each candy item as a list item with its name and quantity.
     - Each item should display the candy name, quantity, and a "Delete" button.
   - Deleting Candies:
     - Clicking the "Delete" button should remove the corresponding candy item from the list.
   - Empty List Message:
     - If there are no candies in the list, display a message like "Your inventory is empty!" to indicate the list is empty.

3.⁠ ⁠Technical Requirements
   - State Management: Use React's useState hook to manage the list of candy items, the current values of the input fields, and their quantities.
   - Event Handling: 
     - Handle changes in the input fields to update the state for candy name and quantity.
     - Handle form submission to add new candy items to the inventory list.
     - Handle click events on the "Delete" button to remove items.


**Project Process**


**Project Challenges**
- Resizing the kenyan flag image to use for the background
- Using ES6 syntax to update the UI when no more items were in the list


**Future Project Improvements / Lessons**
- Improve the readability of items after adding the Kenyan Flag
- Make a moodboard / pintrest board for the colours,fonts, emoji's to use to deploy


**Overall Experience**
- Enjoyable working as a team on code. We covered each others blind spots and made for a more creative end product.
